# Networking Basics #1

---

The aim of this project was to become familiar with utilities such as:

- `nc`
- `telnet`
- `cut`
- `ifconfig`

and also, be able to explain to anyone, without any external help:

- what **localhost**/**127.0.0.1** is
- what **0.0.0.0** is
- what `/etc/hosts` file is
- how to display my machine's active network interfaces
