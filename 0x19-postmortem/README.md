# Post-mortem

A post-mortem, also known as a retrospective or after-action review (AAR), is a
process of reflecting on a project or incident after it has occurred. It
involves a thorough examination of the project or incident to identify what
worked, what didn't, and what could be improved upon in the future.

Post-mortems are typically conducted at the end of a project or after a
significant event, such as a system outage, a security breach, or a customer
complaint. The goal is to learn from the experience and use the insights gained
to improve future projects and prevent similar incidents from happening again.

Post-mortems involve a collaborative effort between team members and
stakeholders, who work together to analyze the data, identify the root cause of
the problem, and develop a plan to address it. The process may involve
interviews, data analysis, and a review of documentation and communication logs.

The output of a post-mortem is typically a report that summarizes the findings
and recommendations for improvement. This report is shared with the team and
stakeholders, and the lessons learned are incorporated into future projects and
processes.
